		<h1>Now this is the story, all about how, my life got flipped turned upside down...</h1>
		<p>Born and raised in Gothenburg, probably one of the worlds best cities, I spent excessive amounts of time playing video games and watching superheroes save the world. I grew up and started high school, in the theater arts programme. I grew a lot as a human being during those years and continued to play my video games and being inspired by the world around me, creating art not only on stage, but broadening into other areas as well. I dabbled with Photoshop, painted a bit and tried to learn photography.</p>
		<p>Now back again to my video games! Growing up I always had a certain connection to my games. Being an only child they were like a good friend when my real friends weren't around. I really did want to work with games when I was a kid. For me, it felt obvious. But, when studying art I kind of lost track of that dream.</p>
		<p>Fast forward a couple of years and I'm working as a bartender after failing to get into an arts school. The year after I tried to get in again, but I knew that chances were pretty slim, so I decided to apply to an engineering preparatory year as well.</p>
		<p>It just so happened to be that I got into the engineering preparatory year at Chalmers. After the preparatory year I started looking at the different programmes and when I saw the Software Engineering was a choice my old dream of working with games spurred back to life.</p>
		<p>Boom! Lifegoal achieved. I got into Software Engingeering. I learned Java as my primary coding language. Things were going well. But here comes the twist...</p>
		<p>I didn't like coding games that much. We had several projects where we made games but it just didn't feel right. Life crisis imminent! I felt a bit lost and it wasn't until the later years of my education I got into web development. I was drawn by the much more creative part of it and I felt like I had good balance between the logical and creative parts. I learned all the nooks and crannies of HTML and CSS I could and learned JavaScript.</p>
		<p>I got a job as a web developer for a smaller project. This led to new oppertunities. I got a chance to create Gothenburg Startup Hacks website 2015, a hackathon with the intentions of connecting startup companies with skilled developers. The hackathon itself was sponsored by Spotify and I worked closely with the Spotify Street Team. I came into contact with a startup company myself and got offered a spot on their team as Lead Designer.</p>
		<p>And the rest my friend, is history...</p>
